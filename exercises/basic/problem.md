# Console Output Submission
This exercise will test the console output against the output of a pre-written solution file
The output is expected to be 'hello, ' followed by the third argument passed into the program (Hint: use process.argv)
For instance, if the value passed in is 'Doguhan', then the expected result is 'hello, Doguhan'
