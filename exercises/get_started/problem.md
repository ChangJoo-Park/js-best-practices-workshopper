# Getting Started
This workshopper will guide you through updating existing code through incremental improvements.  You will learn some of the things that make your JavaScript more maintainable, and what things might make it less maintainable.

You will be making changes to a vending machine.  You will be given a file called `vendingMachine.js`, which the next exercises will have you make changes to.  When you are done, you should be left with a program which accomplishes the same tasks but would be easier to test and update.

The first step in the process is to get the `vendingMachine.js` file.  The file is being currently copied to your working directory.
